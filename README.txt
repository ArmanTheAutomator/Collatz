Collatz Conjecture
**********

The Collatz Conjecture, also known as the 3n+1 conjecture, is an unsolved problem in mathematics.

There is no proof explaining why the sequence always appears to reach "1" for all positive integers, despite
extensive computational verification for a vast range of starting values.

While many mathematicians and computer scientists have investigated the conjecture and obsserved its behavior, a
rigorous proof remains elusive. The conjecture's simplicity and the fact that it remains unresolved make it one of
the most famous open problems in mathematics.

The collatz.py script
**********

The collatz.py script is a simple script that consists of one function (collatz_sequence) and a while loop.

The collatz_sequence function includes the collatz conjecture and computes the result based on the users input. The
function receives a parameter "n" that is used as a placeholder to process the formula.

Then in the while loop, the collatz_sequence function is called but then the input from the user is passed through
as the variable "start_number".

So long as the user inputs a positive integer - no matter how large or small - the collatz_sequence will solve for
1.
